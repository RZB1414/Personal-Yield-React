## 💡 Why I built this project

As a professional volleyball athlete who relocates to a different country each year to play for new teams,  
I constantly deal with financial accounts across multiple banks, brokers, and currencies.  

After struggling to find an app that could manage my international finances the way I needed,  
I decided to build my own tailored solution — starting with the backend, and now with this React frontend.
